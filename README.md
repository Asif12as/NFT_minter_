Introduction
This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for minting Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) by leveraging blockchain technology. It uses React-Vite for the front-end, Express.js for the back-end, and Stardust for smart contract interactions. With this NFT Minter, users can easily create and manage their own unique NFTs.

Features
User-friendly Interface: The web application offers an intuitive interface for users to mint NFTs without technical expertise.
File Upload: Users can upload their image or media files to be associated with the NFT.
Custom Metadata: Users can add custom metadata and attributes to their NFTs.
Stardust Integration: Smart contracts for NFTs are deployed and managed using the Stardust service.
Security: The application includes CORS handling and Multer for secure file uploads.
Responsive Design: The website is designed to work seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes.
Getting Started
To get started with the NFT Minter Website, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nft-minter.git
Install the required dependencies for both the front-end and back-end:

bash
Copy code
cd nft-minter/client
npm install

cd ../server
npm install
Configure the application (see Configuration section).

Start the development servers for both the client and server:

bash
Copy code
# Start the front-end development server
cd ../client
npm run dev

# Start the back-end development server
cd ../api
npm start
Open your browser and access the website at http://localhost:5000.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

client/: Front-end codebase using React-Vite.
server/: Back-end codebase using Express.js.
contracts/: Smart contract code and configuration for Starton.
Configuration
Before running the application, you need to configure some settings:

Set up your Stardust API keys and smart contract configuration with startoon.

Create a .env file in the server/ directory and define the following variables:

env
Copy code
STARton_API_KEY=your-api-key
STARton_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
STARton_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your-contract-address
Replace your-api-key, your-api-secret, and your-contract-address with your actual Stardust credentials and contract address.

Make sure to configure other environment-specific settings like database connection details if applicable.

Usage
Once the application is set up and running, users can access the website and start minting their NFTs. The intuitive interface will guide them through the process, allowing them to upload files, add metadata, and finalize the minting.
